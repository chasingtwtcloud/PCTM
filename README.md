# PCTM
PCTM for SAR and optical template matching. These codes are running on the Matlab environment

You can run 'main.m' to try the template matching. 

You can download representative image pairs here: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1BGq8AnLHlCK20v_eI6N6Sw?pwd=dxnz

These image pairs can be put in the folder 'test_img' to test the codes. 

You can also change the 'sar_path' and 'opt_path' in 'main.m' to try the template matching of your images.
